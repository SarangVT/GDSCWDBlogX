It is primarily developed for <b>GDSC Web Dev Induction</B>.
Task No: 5 Full Stack Beginner (Blogging Application)<br/>
Hosted Link: Github Pages(https://sarangvt.github.io/GDSCWebDevFrontend/)<br/>
Cooperate and please refresh the page some times as the connection of backend on render becomes lazy, after some time, it has less traffic.<br/>

Roadmap for Code Base:
1. Backend:
  Tech Stack: Node js, Express JS, additional dependencies can be tracked from package.json<br/>
  How to Run?<br/>
  Install node, mongodb compass.<br/>
  Update the mongodb link for your device, in the auth.js in Services make sure cookie config is set for http.<br/>
  Make a .env file and give http://localhost:3000 as clientLink, secretKey, MONGODB_LINK, should be set according to your config.<br/>
  npm install<br/>
  node index.js<br/>

2. Frontend:
  Tech Stack: React JS<br/>
  How to Run?<br/>
  npm install<br/>
  npm start<br/>

Code base is simple, tried to be as easy as possible, but still complexities persists(depends), start from index.js in both backend and frontend, and track the imports to roam all over the small codebase.
<br/>Thanks for giving your precious time.<br/>
